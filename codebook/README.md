# Stance coding codebook

This folder contains the **codebook** we use for stance codings. 

The overall [Codebook](codebook.md) ([NL](codebook-nl.md)) containing instructions for how to recognize and classify stances in general, including some decisions on edge cases on when something should be classified as 'no stance' rathern than as a stance.

The [Topic list](topics-en.md) (([NL](codebook-nl.md)) contains the definition of the topics used, such as trade policy and civil rights. Each topic can be seen as an issue dimension, for which we define two opposite positions. For example, for trade policy the two positions are are *free trade* and *protectionism*.   

Note that the topic list files linked above automatically generated from a [master topic list](topics.yml) in YAML format using the script in [src/actions/generate_topics.py](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/issuepositions/blob/main/src/actions/generate_topics.py)
